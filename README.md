# CMS (un-official) Docker images

**Warning**: This project aims to package the [CMS](https://github.com/cms-dev/cms)
platform core components as Docker images, but still this approach is not
recognized neither tested by the CMS core development team, so if you are planning
to host a local programming contest using the aforementioned platform is
*highly recommended* to follow the installation proccess described in the
[CMS manual](https://cms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) instead.

## Why?

**tl;dr** By packagign CMS platform components the installation and deployment
process complexity and time should be reduced.

## Making it run

**TODO**

- [CMS](https://github.com/cms-dev/cms) platform and [CMS community](https://github.com/cms-dev/cms/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt)
